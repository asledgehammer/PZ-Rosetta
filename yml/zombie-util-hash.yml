        This class provides a default hash function for
          int values. It has been derived from the Java library and
          is known to work well in the general case.

        This interface represents hash functions from int values
          to int values. The int value result is chosen to achieve

        This class provides a static table of int sized prime numbers.
          For small numbers (0-511) it contains all primes. For larger
          numbers it contains 32 primes each time the number of bits is
          increased. I.e., there are 32 primes from 512 to 1023,
          32 primes from 1024 to 2048, etc., the primes thus becoming less
          dense with size. Within the interval formed by using one more
          bit (say, v0 to v1), the 32 primes are formed by searching for
          the first prime greater than or equal to v0 + n*(v1-v0)/32, n
          belonging to {0,1,2, ..., 31}. This creates a reasonable
          distribution.
