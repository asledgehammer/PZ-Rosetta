        This class represents an abstract base for implementing
          collections of int values. All operations that can be implemented
          using iterators are implemented as such. In most cases, this is
          hardly an efficient solution, and at least some of those
          methods should be overridden by sub-classes.

        A thread-safe object pool. Useful for re-using memory without it falling
        into the garbage collector.

         Beware: Once an item has been allocated, it MUST be released at some point by calling its release() function.
                 If not, the item's memory will never be recycled, and it will be considered a memory leak.
