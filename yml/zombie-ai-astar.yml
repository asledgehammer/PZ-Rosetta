  javaType: interface
  notes: >-
    A tagging interface for an object representing the entity in the game that
     is going to moving along the path. This allows us to pass around entity/state
     information to determine whether a particular tile is blocked, or how much
     cost to apply on a particular tile.

     For instance, a Mover might represent a tank or plane on a game map. Passing round
     this entity allows us to determine whether rough ground on a map should effect
     the unit's cost for moving through the tile.
