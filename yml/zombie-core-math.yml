            Almost Identity

             Imagine you don't want to modify a signal unless it's drops to zero or close to it, in which case you want
             to replace the value with a small possitive constant. Then, rather than clamping the value and introduce
             a discontinuity, you can smoothly blend the signal into the desired clipped value. So, let m be the threshold
             (anything above m stays unchanged), and n the value things will take when the signal is zero.
             Then, the following function does the soft clipping (in a cubic fashion):

            Almost Unit Identity

             This is a near-identiy function that maps the unit interval into itself. It is the cousin of smoothstep(), in
             that it maps 0 to 0, 1 to 1, and has a 0 derivative at the origin, just like smoothstep. However, instead of
             having a 0 derivative at 1, it has a derivative of 1 at that point. It's equivalent to the Almost Identiy above
             with n=0 and m=1. Since it's a cubic just like smoothstep() it is very fast to evaluate.

            Gain

             Remapping the unit interval into the unit interval by expanding the sides and compressing the center, and
             keeping 1/2 mapped to 1/2, that can be done with the gain() function. This was a common function in RSL tutorials
             (the Renderman Shading Language). k=1 is the identity curve, k<1 produces the classic gain() shape, and k>1
             produces "s" shaped curces. The curves are symmetric (and inverse) for k=a and k=1/a.
