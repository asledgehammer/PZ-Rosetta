      Returns buildings that could occlude some of the square.
       Depending on the exact shape of the building, the square might not be hidden at all.
       This is used to hide buildings that might block our view of something in a square (at ground level)

    notes: >-
      Returns whether built structures with no building id (orphans) could
      occlude some of the square.
       Depending on the exact shape of the structures, the square might not be hidden at all.
       This is used to hide player-built structures that might block our view of something in a square (at ground
       level)
