# zombie.ai.astar.Mover
package: zombie.ai.astar
type: interface
name: Mover
modifiers:
  - public
notes: >-
  A tagging interface for an object representing the entity in the game that
   is going to moving along the path. This allows us to pass around entity/state
   information to determine whether a particular tile is blocked, or how much
   cost to apply on a particular tile.

   For instance, a Mover might represent a tank or plane on a game map. Passing round
   this entity allows us to determine whether rough ground on a map should effect
   the unit's cost for moving through the tile.
