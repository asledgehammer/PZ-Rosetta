extends: Object
modifiers:
  - public
  - abstract
notes: |-
  This class represents an abstract base for implementing
    maps from int values to objects. All operations that can be implemented
    using iterators
    are implemented as such. In most cases, this is
    hardly an efficient solution, and at least some of those
    methods should be overridden by sub-classes.

      Does nothing. Sub-classes may provide an implementation to
        minimize memory usage, but this is not required since many
        implementations will always have minimal memory usage.
