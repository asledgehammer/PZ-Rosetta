  This class provides a static table of int sized prime numbers.
    For small numbers (0-511) it contains all primes. For larger
    numbers it contains 32 primes each time the number of bits is
    increased. I.e., there are 32 primes from 512 to 1023,
    32 primes from 1024 to 2048, etc., the primes thus becoming less
    dense with size. Within the interval formed by using one more
    bit (say, v0 to v1), the 32 primes are formed by searching for
    the first prime greater than or equal to v0 + n*(v1-v0)/32, n
    belonging to {0,1,2, ..., 31}. This creates a reasonable
    distribution.

      Returns from a static prime table the least prime that is greater
        than or equal to a specified value.

        On average, the returned prime will about 1/64 of 2
