  This class represents an abstract base for implementing
    lists of int values. All operations that can be implemented
    using iterators and the
methods:
  - name: add
    modifiers:
      - public
    returnType: void
    parameters:
      - name: index
        type: int
        notes: |-
          the index at which to add the element. If
                        index == size() the element is appended
                        to this list.
      - name: v
        type: int

  - name: addAll
    modifiers:
      - public
    returnType: boolean
    parameters:
      - name: index
        type: int
        notes: |-
          the index at which to insert the elements of
                        the specified collection. If
                        index == size() the elements are appended
                        to this list.

          the index at which to start the search. Note that
