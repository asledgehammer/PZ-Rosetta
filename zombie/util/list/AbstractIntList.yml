  This class represents an abstract base for implementing
    lists of int values. All operations that can be implemented
    using iterators and the
methods:
  - name: add
    modifiers:
      - public
    return:
      type: boolean
      notes: |-
        true if this collection was modified
                      as a result of adding v; returns
                      false otherwise.
    parameters:
      - name: v
        type: int
        notes: the element to add to this collection.
