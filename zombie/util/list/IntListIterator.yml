extends: IntIterator
modifiers:
  - public
notes: This class represents iterators over lists of int values.
methods:
  - name: add
    return:
      type: void
    parameters:
      - name: v
        type: int
        notes: the element to add.
    notes: |-
      Adds a specified element to the list at this iterator's
        current position.
  - name: hasPrevious
    return:
      type: boolean
      notes: |-
        true if more int values can be returned
                      by this iterator in backwards direction; returns
                      false otherwise.
    notes: |-
      Indicates whether more int values can be returned by this
        iterator by calling
  - name: nextIndex
    return:
      type: int
      notes: |-
        the index of the element that would be returned by
                      a call to next().
    notes: |-
      Returns the index of the element that would be returned by
        a call to
  - name: previous
    return:
      type: int
      notes: the previous int value of this iterator.
    notes: Returns the previous int value of this iterator.
  - name: previousIndex
    return:
      type: int
      notes: |-
        the index of the element that would be returned by
                      a call to previous(); if no more elements
                      are available in backwards direction, -1
                      is returned.
    notes: |-
      Returns the index of the element that would be returned by
        a call to
  - name: set
    return:
      type: void
    parameters:
      - name: v
        type: int
        notes: the new value of the element.
    notes: Sets the last element returned to a specified value.
