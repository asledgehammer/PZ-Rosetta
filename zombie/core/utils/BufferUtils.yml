    notes: >-
      Direct buffers are garbage collected by using a phantom reference and a
       reference queue. Every once a while, the JVM checks the reference queue and
       cleans the direct buffers. However, as this doesn't happen
       immediately after discarding all references to a direct buffer, it's
       easy to OutOfMemoryError yourself using direct buffers. This function
       explicitly calls the Cleaner method of a direct buffer.

      Set it to true if you want to enable direct memory tracking for debugging
      purpose.
       Default is false.
       To print direct memory usage use BufferUtils.printCurrentDirectMemory(StringBuilder store);
