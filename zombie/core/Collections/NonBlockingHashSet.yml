      Atomically make the set immutable.  Future calls to mutate will throw an
       IllegalStateException.  Existing mutator calls in other threads racing
       with this thread and will either throw IllegalStateException or their
       update will be visible to this thread.  This implies that a simple flag
       cannot make the Set immutable, because a late-arriving update in another
       thread might see immutable flag not set yet, then mutate the Set after

      Current count of elements in the set.  Due to concurrent racing updates,
       the size is only ever approximate.  Updates due to the calling thread are
       immediately visible to calling thread.
